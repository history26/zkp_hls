This repository contains implementations of important operators in ZKP protocols, specifically MSM and NTT.

The implemented MSM and NTT support scales and bit-widths that meet the requirements of common ZKP protocols.

The implementation is written in C/C++ and has been optimized for common FPGA toolchains. It supports compilation into .xo files and linking into .xclbin files.
